For possible projects of interest, I was thinking of doing something related to gaming, a some generic useful software tool, or some small simple webapp. Of course, these are just the areas I want to work in; I haven't necessarily thought about the specifics of the project yet. I would probably use te blessed repository format for organization, since I have used this in the past for other projects and I think it'll prevent most common conflicts.
